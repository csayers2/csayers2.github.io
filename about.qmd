I am a PhD candidate, NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and NASA Early Career Researcher in the Tingley Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles. I also hold affiliate researcher positions at the Centro de Innovación Científica Amazónica in Puerto Maldonado, Peru and the Biodiversity Research Institute in Portland, Maine.

My research centers on how bird communities respond to habitat degradation and pollution caused by gold mining in Amazonia, with the intent to inform resource extraction and conservation decision making.
