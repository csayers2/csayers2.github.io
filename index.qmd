I am a bird conservation biologist and ecotoxicologist — an "ecotoxic-ornithologist" — in the Tingley Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in Ecology, and a NASA Future Investigator in Earth Sciences.

While I am broadly interested in how human-induced drivers of global change impact biological diversity, I often focus on environmental pollution as a widely-neglected stressor with fatal consequences. As species attempt to adapt on a rapidly changing planet, it is critical to understand how pollution can influence various aspects of their life history: behavior, migration, reproduction, and survival.

I currently research how bird communities in Amazonia respond to mercury pollution, and other environmental disturbances caused by gold mining, with the intent to inform resource extraction and conservation decision making.
