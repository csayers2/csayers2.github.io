title: "Optimizing heavy metal biomonitoring in the tropics"
description: "As mining industries expand to meet the global demand for precious minerals, heavy metal pollution is becoming commonplace throughout the tropics. Blood sampling provides a reliable, nonlethal measurement to track contamination in organisms, but storing samples can be impractical in remote field conditions. I am developing a simple, inexpensive method to assess heavy metal exposure in birds without needing refrigeration – thereby removing logistical barriers for scientists based in the tropics."
